# Running motivator app
For those days where you just don't feel like a run. Inspired by Nike Head Coach, Coach Bennet, who motivated me through my first 5km, 10km and half marathon. He has a way with words I have tried to capture in this fun application.

## Idea Backlog
- Personalisation, so the ability to build a profile, tell it what races you're doing, what your plan looks like and it will use that info to write the motivation. Logging in/authentication with this too.
- Fully flesh out the "should I run today?" workflow to be a useful tool to decide if you should run or have a rest day. Could add other paths for like "skip the speed, just run easy" etc.

## V0 Integration
I use v0 to assist me in development. It provides assistance with code but also the main benefit I find is how easy it is to deploy and share apps. I try to use v0 as a peer, like I'm pair programming, to help me learn more, rather than vibe coding through all of it. It also allows me to log in on any machine so coding on the go can be a bit easier, like code-sandbox.
